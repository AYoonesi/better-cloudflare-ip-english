## Windows batch version

Translated:
Please download the Release version to use, do not use Git Clone to download (garbled characters will appear)
Windows 7 users recommend using the ANSI encoded version
Users of Windows 8 and above versions are recommended to use the UTF-8 encoded version
Note: The ANSI encoding version can be used on all Windows platforms, and the BUG of some Windows systems will cause the console to output garbled characters

In this translated version these problems are gone, so there are no difference between UTF-8 and ANSI here.
